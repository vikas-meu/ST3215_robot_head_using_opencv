SCServo Head-Tracker

High-resolution head-tracking using MediaPipe + OpenCV (Python) and SC (ST-series) servos controlled by an ESP32.
The Python script computes head yaw/pitch and sends high-resolution servo commands to the ESP32 over serial. The ESP32 receives yaw,pos\n commands and moves SC servos (0â€“4095 range).
